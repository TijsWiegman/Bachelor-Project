This folder contains the documents used in the sections 4.5 and 4.6 of my thesis. With 3D we mean this folder corresponds to the problem in the full 3 dimensional search space, where we experimented with different exploration parameters and acquisition functions. This folder corresponds to the BO package. The 'CreateAverages.py' and 'CreateSampleStdDev.py' were used to create the 'average' and 'sample std dev' files in the folder. On how to use the code, see the tutorial.

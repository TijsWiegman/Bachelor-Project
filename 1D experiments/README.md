This folder contains the documents used in the '1D plots' section of my thesis. The .json files contain all target values in the single dimension in its name (i.e. 1d_slice_p.json contains every target value for different values of p with both h and r constant). The file Python files are used to implement the algorithm and produce the animations, see the tutorial.
